# fast_expr

Generates code over (mutually-)recursive enums to write custom map/fold/zipper-like without worrying
about the boilerplate code.

**NB**: fast_expr is not really released yet. Refer to the book (WIP), either by looking at the
[sources on the repo](./book/src/SUMMARY.md), or by cloning the repo and generating it with
[`mdbook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).
